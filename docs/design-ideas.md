# Design ideas

## Time mechanics

At the end of the level, display the time it took to beat, as well as some "discounts" for specific actions like dropping the rock on an enemy, getting really close behind them, or hiding in the weeds. Also time penalties for screwing up.

## Story

Show the story gradually as the levels proceed (like in dark souls) instead of a lore dump at the beginning (like in dark souls)

## Distribution

Split the game into the first few levels, and the rest of the levels. This should let the player try before they buy.

## Difficulty

Difficulty should have peaks and valleys. Levels should be sequences of

- Easy
- Moderate
- Hard
- Easy
- Moderate
- Hard

...etc

## More mechanics / gimmick ideas

- Screaming rock: it doesn't like it when you move it too much, making you stop every 5 seconds or so. Otherwise it will scream and alert the enemies.
- Magnet-affected rock
- Portal/conveyor belt/ventilation shaft: adds a third dimension to the topology of the levels. Thing comes in, and goes out the other side.
  - Maybe some are rock-only, others are submarine-only, and others allow the rock and the sub also
- Unscripted enemies: rule based enemies that react deterministically to your presence.
